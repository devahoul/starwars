Instructions\Reminders
------------------------------------------------------------

1.DO NOT MAKE ANY EDITS TO TOOLS.INI. If you do, make sure there is an empty line after the last one, if the last one has text in it.

2.Open my munge tools by running Visual Munge SWBF1.exe.

3.Be sure to back up SideBuilder to BackUp so you can revert your changes.

4.Before doing anything, click the NEW MOD button and click on PROJECT, then NEW PROJECT. 

5.Once you create a new project, restart my tool to get rid of errors that occur due to no mod detected.

6.In order to do most functions in my tool, you must select which mod ID you are using in the text box.

7.Here is the order of the process: Creation, editing, munging, and compiling (which copies munged files into the addon folder).

8.Doing any compiling will delete what is already in addon.

9.To run the mod, copy your mod folder in addon to <DIR>\Gamedata\Addon (DIR is most likely C:\Program Files (x86)\Star Wars Battlefront)

10.My contact information and legal information is in my tool, then help, then about. Read the EULA for more legal information.
