This is a prototype Work In Progress of BFBuilder Pro.

BFBuilder Pro is not fully compatible with previous mods and
all of it's functionality is not implemented or complete. There 
are no help files.

Opening a project created with previous versions of BFBuilder may or may not 
break the project. Use it at your own risk.

So what good is it? The interface has been upgraded to include menu 
options for sound files and limited functionality for creating and 
importing sides. 

Creating a new side automatically creates an empty sides folder structure 
and edits the appropriate munge file for the side to be included in the munge.
Importing a side imports an existing side from the Assets folder and updates 
the apprpriate files required to include it in the munge. Edit sides does not work 
yet.

The edit sound menu provides links that open the sound config files for editing if 
they exist. Instructions for setting up the sound files are not included and the setup 
is not automated. If you've read the tutorials and/or know what the file format for 
these files are then this menu provides quick access to edit files.


This work in progress is not supported but it may make development easier while it's 
development continues.
